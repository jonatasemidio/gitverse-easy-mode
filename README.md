## The father :: Linus
Here you can find just a brief history about the creator of git and the reason
[Font: Git official page] (https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-A-Short-History-of-Git)

## Why RCS?
Some important information about why to use RCS, before jump on the GIT journey.
* more info:
- [Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revision_Control_System)
- [Patterns for Managing Source Code Branches](https://martinfowler.com/articles/branching-patterns.html) *Advanced but very important content*


## Why GIT?
Git is more connected with you them you can imagine.

## Why GITHUB?
Github was one of the most important tools connecting us with our favorite open source apps.

## Some baby steps
Just to start, here I show the git happy path. The flow thats will always be in our git journey.
* init
* add .
* commit 
* push

## Real life
Life is always harder than books. Here the idea is to show some situations that could bring some complexity in our happy path. Eg: shared code, merges, finding bugs, etc.

## Challenges and interesting features
Adding more information on the real life topic, here is where our samples start divided in some funny topics.

## Sometimes bug happens
This topic is responsible to describe how git can help us to spot added bugs in our code. Using features like logs and diffs.

## Fix & Save
Here, we are not fixing and saving our code. But understanding the best way of doing it. With short and meaningful slots of time between commit and be clear on the commit message.

## Keep it clean
Be like a good scout and keep cleaner than before. Here, I will share the sad story of my last experience at the university, developing without git. Eg. creating different zip files of the projects with different names followed by numbers representing the version.

## Mind your long journey code
One of the most important aspects of versioning your code is keep your journey to commit short. Here I am comparing how hard could be a fix without this approach.

## You are not alone
Enjoy how nice it is to work in a distributed environment, but this power brings great reponsibilities. Here we share some features like, branch, pull and merge.

## Dealing with madness
Just a slide showing how could be your night if you and your team avoid following the best practices on versioning.

## Let's work as a team
A bit of how nice (and important) is to work in open source projects.

## Who bitten my cake
Using git blame to find who is the best person to help you (in a funny way).

## Organize your room
Some approaches to organize your repository. Eg. labeling, branch name pattern, cleaning unnecessary branches and modularization. 

## Less headache more time to enjoy your code
To conclude, how versioning can give you time to live your life and enjoy what you really love.
